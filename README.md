## Quick Overview

The page, from top to bottom, consists of:

- Controls to filter the data
- A chart with downloads or revenue data
- A table of the app and sales data

There is a single endpoint, "data.json" that returns sales data. The data looks like so:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Clash of Clans",
    "icon": "image_url",
    "data": [
      ["2020-01-01", 80000, 9808000],
      ["2020-01-02", 70000, 9790000],
      ["2020-01-03", 70000, 9000000],
      ["2020-01-04", 95000, 3500000],
      ["2020-01-05", 90000, 2000000],
      ["2020-01-06", 65000, 1241201],
      ["2020-01-07", 42000, 2424241]
    ],
  }, ...
]
```

Each element in the "data" array is a tuple of the date, downloads, and revenue in cents.

The page should look like this before you do any work:

After you are done with the tasks below, the page can look like this:

## Tasks

Here are the tasks you should complete:

### Controls

- [ ] Add Downloads and Revenue buttons (aka "measures")
  - [ ] They should be roughly formatted according to the screenshots
  - [ ] The selected button should have a light blue background

### Chart

- [ ] The title should say...
  - [ ] "Downloads by App" when the downloads button is selected
  - [ ] "Revenue by App" when the revenue button is selected
- [ ] The chart should show revenue data when the Revenue button is selected
- [ ] The chart should only plot points within (and including) the start and end date inputs
  - [ ] It should automatically update when the start or end date inputs change
- [ ] The chart subtitle should have the date range:
  - e.g. "Jan 01, 2020 - Jan 07, 2020"
  - [ ] It should automatically update when the start or end date inputs change
- [ ] The chart's Y Axis should say "Downloads" or "Revenue ($)" depending on the selected measures
- [ ] The chart's X Axis should have formatted dates:
  - e.g. "Jan 01, 20'", "Jan 07, 20'", etc

### Table

- [ ] Make the header row text bold
- [ ] Fix the calculation for the total downloads cells
- [ ] The download cells should be formatted with thousands commas
  - E.G. 80000 downloads should be "80,000"
- [ ] Add a column for Revenue
  - [ ] The table header should say "Revenue"
  - [ ] The revenue cells should have the revenue, formatted with a dollar sign and commas. EG: "$140,043.51"
- [ ] Add a column for "Revenue per Download"
  - [ ] The table header should say "RPD"
  - [ ] The RPD cells should have the revenue divided by downloads. If the value is invalid, the cell should say "-".
  - [ ] The RPD cells should be formatted like the Revenue column
- [ ] The table should only use data within (and including) the start and end date inputs to calculate the total downloads/revenue/RPD.

### Bonus

- [ ] Add a loading state for the chart and table
- [ ] In the table, add each app's icon next to app name in the `App Name` column
- [ ] Address any inefficiencies in the code
